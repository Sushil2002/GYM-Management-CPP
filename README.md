# GYM-Management-CPP

As the name suggests the Gym Management System is a software that handles the entire data of the Gym. 
It makes the work of a Fitness Manager very easy instead of writing data in a notebook. In past, the gym managers were using notebooks to write the data along
with customersâ€™ names who purchased the gym memberships. So it was very difficult to keep track of each and every record.
If a Gym Manager wants to search for a particular gym record then that task was very time-consuming. So to make this task easy the programming 
languages were developed and the C++ language is one of them.
